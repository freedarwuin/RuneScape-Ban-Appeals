Macroing Appeal (English)

Hello Jagex Support,

I would like to sincerely apologize for the actions that led to this ban. I understand the violation and its impact on the game. I ask for another chance, and I commit to never using macros or automation again. I want to continue being part of the RuneScape community legitimately.

Thank you for reconsidering my case.
