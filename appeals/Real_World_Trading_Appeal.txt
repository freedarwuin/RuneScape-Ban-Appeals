Real World Trading Major Appeal (English)

Hello Jagex Support,

I understand that my account was banned for Real World Trading.
I would like to clarify that this may have happened without my direct involvement, possibly due to my account being compromised.

I have taken full responsibility to secure my account:
- I have reset my password,
- Updated my recovery information,
- And enabled the Authenticator.

I kindly request a review of this case. I value RuneScape and the community, and I assure you that I will never engage in any activity related to RWT in the future.

Thank you for your time and consideration.
